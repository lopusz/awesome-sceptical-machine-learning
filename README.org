   + Geoffrey Hinton "We have to start over"
     + [[https://www.axios.com/artificial-intelligence-pioneer-says-we-need-to-start-over-1513305524-f619efbd-9db0-4947-a9b2-7a4c310a28fe.html][interview with Axios]]
     + "My view is throw it all away and start again,"
     + "I don't think it's how the brain works," he said. "We clearly don't need all the labeled data."
     + But Hinton suggested that, to get to where neural networks are able to become intelligent on their own, what is known as "unsupervised learning," "I suspect that means getting rid of back-propagation."

   + Reinforcement Learning does not work yet
     - Whenever someone asks me if reinforcement learning can solve their problem, I tell them it can’t. I think this is right at least 70% of the time.
     - "… great read, hits a lot of points I've also come to realize over last ~2 years. 70% is a vast understatement.", A. Karpathy ([[https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/963850798886039552][here]])
